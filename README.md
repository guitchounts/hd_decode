# Code for Decoding 3D Head Direction from Primary Visual Cortex Neural Activity
Includes scripts to gather and model neural activity and behavioral data recorded from freely moving rats as part of my PhD work. Code gathers stored on Harvard's cluster, creates scripts for batch processing on the SLURM scheduler, submits the jobs, and creates linear or deep neural network models to decode 3D head direction from V1 neural activity using various configurations of moving/resting state, experimental condition (dark or light behavioral arena), temporal window sizes, and offsets between neural activity and behavior.

Data described in the paper Stable 3D Head Direction Signals in the Primary Visual Cortex, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.283762v2.
